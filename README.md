# The DirtyChore web app 

## Overview

This web app simplifies the process of assigning chores to a household and incentifies the tasks.

Each week the chores will be rotated so everyone gets a chance to do each chore.

One person will be assigned the role of the **monitor** to make sure every person is doing their job.
At the end of the week, the monitor ranks the quality of each job in this manner and awards points.

Every month, the person with the most points wins the chance for a "get-out-of-chores-week" voucher
that they can use whenever they choose.

The person who uses a voucher has their chore passed onto a random person in the household.
